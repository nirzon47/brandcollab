# BrandCollab

## [Hosted Link](https://brandcollab.vercel.app/)

This project is made to showcase my knowledge of React and Tailwind CSS as a part of BrandCollab's hiring process.

## Features

- All UI components are dynamic.
- Responsive design.
- Clean and minimal UI.
- Semantic HTML.
- Accessible.

## Assumptions made

- Data is fetched from backend so a mockup with localStorage is used.
- Profile section is not editable as it would be a security risk. Only the tags are editable.
- Editing a product brings up a dialog with the same fields as the product.
- Adding a product adds a new product to the list.
- Adding a testimonial brings up a dialog with the same fields as the testimonial.
- Few UI/UX designs were assumed since the project was a quick mockup.

## Tech Stack

- Typescript
- React
- Radix UI
- Tailwind CSS
